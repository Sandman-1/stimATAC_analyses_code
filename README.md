# Functional Inference of Gene Regulation (FigR)

Core code associated with manuscript detailing scATAC and scRNA-seq integration worflow

FigR is a computational framework for supporting the integration of single cell chromatin accessibility and gene expression data to infer transcriptional regulators of target genes

FigR uses independently or concomitantly-profiled single-cell ATAC-seq (scATAC-seq) and scRNA-seq, to 
i) computationally-pair scATAC-seq and scRNA-seq datasets (if needed), ii) infers cis-regulatory interactions, and iii) defines a TF-gene gene regulatory network (GRN)
